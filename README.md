# Stevenage Chess Club Website

## Introduction

The Stevenage Chess Club website is designed to be a low maintenance website
which club members can easily update.

It's hosted for free on GitHub Pages. The only cost is for the
[stevenage-chess-club.co.uk](https://stevenage-chess-club.co.uk) domain name
purchased through https://123-reg.co.uk

The website was initially generated using [Claude AI](https://claude.ai)
using the following prompts:
> I'd like to create a simple website for a chess club with a side menu hosted on GitHub pages.
> This should convert markdown based content into a website.
> Improve the website so it displays correctly on a mobile phone.

Ideally, the stevenagechessclub github org should have at least 2 members to ensure
the club doesn't lose access to the site.

## Instructions for Club Members

The website is hosted by github.com, a large software development cloud platform owned by Microsoft.

2. Become a member of the stevenagechessclub github org

Once you have a github account, the next step is to get access to the website files. To do this, share your
github username with the Club Website Administrator and they will add you to the
