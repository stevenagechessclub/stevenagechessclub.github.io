# Stevenage Chess Club Website

## Introduction

The Stevenage Chess Club website is designed to be a low maintenance website
which club members can easily update.

It's hosted for free on GitHub Pages. The only cost is for the
[stevenage-chess-club.co.uk](https://stevenage-chess-club.co.uk) domain name
purchased through https://123-reg.co.uk

The website was initially generated using [Claude AI)(https://claude.ai)
using the following prompts:
> I'd like to create a simple website for a chess club with a side menu hosted on GitHub pages.
> This should convert markdown based content into a website.
> Improve the website so it displays correctly on a mobile phone.

## Instructions for Club Members

1. Create a github Account

The website is hosted by github.com, a large software development cloud platform owned by Microsoft.
To contribute to the website, you first need to create a github account. Sign up at https://github.com/signup

2. Become a member of the stevenagechessclub github org

Once you have a github account, the next step is to get access to the website files. To do this, share your
github username with the Club Website Administrator and they will add you to the
[stevenagechessclub](https://github.com/orgs/stevenagechessclub/people)
github organisation.

**Important** Ideally, the stevenagechessclub github org should have at least 2 club members to ensure
we don't lose access.

3. Edit the website

The website is built from simple markdown text files.
