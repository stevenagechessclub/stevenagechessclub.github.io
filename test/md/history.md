and Stevenage Chess Club AGMs, we've put together this history of the club.

If old members want to contribute further, we'd love to hear from you. Please email the club <stevenage-chess-club@googlegroups.com>.

- Following the end of the 1939-45 war there was an urgent Government
requirement for new and replacement housing in the Country. In
November 1946, Stevenage was designated the first new town to address this
issue and shortly after this the Stevenage Development Corporation was
formed and based out of
[Aston House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_House). Employees there
formed a Chess Club and during these early years affiliated with the
Hertfordshire Chess Association (HCA) as Aston House.
- In the early 50's new housing was appearing in Stevenage and this was
providing a new workforce which attracted industries and businesses. The
[English Electric Co. Ltd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Electric)
was one of the first factories to settle on a 70 acre site and employees
there also affiliated with the HCA as English Electric, playing out of the
English Electric Sports and Social Club at Bragbury End.
- The 1959-60 season saw 17 members, 6 from English Electric and 4 from
Aston House, affiliate with the HCA as Stevenage Chess Club (SCC) to compete
in the 1960-61 season playing out of offices at 13 Town Square. This season
also saw Alleynians affiliate playing out of the Thomas Alleynes Grammar
School. It would appear a couple of members linked to both of these clubs
probably  hoping to ensure their involvement the coming season.
- The HCA Team competition comprised of the Puller Cup for those deemed
Division One Teams, and the Montague-Jones Board for those deemed Division
Two Teams. Division Two depending upon the number of teams affiliated was
spread across 2 or 3 Sections. Participation in which Division was decided
by the HCA and SCC would be placed in Division One, while Aston House,
English Electric and Alleynians would all compete in the same Division Two
Northern Section.
- The 1960-61 season would see Stevenage Chess Club (SCC) emerge as a
strength in Hertfordshire Chess attracting other good players, but would
also see Aston House compete for the last time. In their first season SCC
would win the Puller Cup.

- At County level, R.W. Ross and A.P. Primett were established players and
G.J.Coleman can be seen often playing at Board 3 or 4.
- The 1961-62 season would see English Electric compete for the last time
and T.K.Hemmingway would win the Capel Cup, the Individual County Champion.
This victory would be recorded as
  > won by J. Hemmingway of English Electric and Stevenage Clubs
linking the past to the present and the future.
- SCC were now playing matches out of the Stevenage College of Further
Education and this would be their home for a number of years.
- The Tabulator Limited company moved to Letchworth in 1920, and Tabulators
were a long standing member of the HCA. A merger in 1959 saw
[International Computers and Tabulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computers_and_Tabulators) (ICT) created with works in Letchworth and
Stevenage. ICT would merge with English Electric Computers in 1968
becoming part of [ICL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computers_Limited). Fujitsu became sole shareholder of ICL in the late 1990s and was eventually rebranded to Fujitsu.
- 1962-63 sees ICT Stevenage affiliate for the coming season playing out of
the ICT Canteen in Bessemer Drive. Mr A. Simm, Secretary for SCC would also
act in this role for the ICT team.
![history-1964-yearbook-club-details.jpg](images/history-1964-yearbook-club-details.jpg)
- 1963-64 sees Heathcote affiliate for the next season and will appear as
Heathcote School with the Secretary being P.A.J. Brown.
- 1964-65 sees Heathcote School win the Eastern Section of the
Montague-Jones board, however this will be the only season they compete at
the Senior level. They are recorded as competing in the play-off for the
overall winner, but the result is not recorded.
- 1965-66 sees the HCA create their first Player Grading list, with the
final amount of work being carried out by the County Grader,
J.A.C. Borland, a SCC member and County player. The Grading was based upon
playing a certain number of games which excluded T.K.Hemmingway who
was playing County Board 2 behind G.J. Coleman. This Grading shows the
growing strength of SCC and two others from this list will appear for them
in the coming seasons.
- 1966-67 see ICT Stevenage entered as ICT and they win the Eastern Section
of the Montague-Jones Board and also see Stevenage enter a second team in
this Section. This is also the last season ICT will appear.
- 1967 saw the HCA restructure Chess in Hertfordshire to a Divisional
structure with promotion and relegation allowing multiple teams for
affiliated clubs. This change saw SCC enter three teams into this new
structure all under Stevenage Chess Club (SCC).
![history-1968-yearbook-divisions.jpg](images/history-1968-yearbook-divisions.jpg)
- 1967-68 saw SCC Division 1 Winners and also Division 2 Winners and
Promotion.
- 1968-69 was even more successful with SCC becoming Division 1 Winners and
Runners Up. The
[Hertfordshire Chess Association News Bulletin September 1969](https://e2-e4.co.uk/Herts-Mag/1969-September-No7.pdf)
reports on Stevenage:
  > Not content that their First team should win the League, Stevenage Second team were runners up. The Greeks had a word for this - Autocracy
- The same News Bulletin has an article from T.B. Bennett detailing what could be seen as the high water mark of Club Chess in Stevenage.
- 1968-69 also sees SCC reach the last eight of the British National Club
Championship. A team comprising of:
  1. G.J. Coleman was already an experienced county player with Hampshire from
    the age of 14. He was employed in Stevenage by Kodak as a development
    engineer, He was a Herts County Champion and runner up.

    three times, the first while at Welwyn in 1953-54, he was also County

- One County Match showed the Strength of SCC with 8 of the top 11 boards filled with their players, being 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 11.
- After the high come the low. The same Archive No. 7 holds the Obituary for G.J. Coleman. For Geoff a part read
  > ... none of our  players had a better record for the County than he
  > ... Rarely, if ever, can our Association have lost one of its Champions so young and so tragically.
- 1975-76 was the seventeenth season since SCC had joined the HCA and were
placed in Division 1. This season was also the seventh time they were
Champions and the seventh time they had won the Puller Team Knock-Out Cup.
- There are many individual achievements at Club and County from Players in
Stevenage, however the Division 1 title would not return to Stevenage until
1992-93, this time in the hands of Pin Green.
- 1978 saw Pin Green Chess Club in Stevenage affiliate with the HCA where they would play from 1978-79 until 1999.

## Recollections from club members

### Peter Brown

> I believe that the Club was first formed in the late 1950’s and its original venue was the offices of the Stevenage Development Corporation Daneshill House Danestrete - the same premises now occupied by Stevenage Borough Council. At least 2 of the original members worked for British Aerospace including Keith Hemingway (former British under 21 champion) and Paddy Ross. Other members included Geoff Coleman (match captain) and two pupils From Alleynes Grammar School - Rodney Lighton and Alan Griffiths.
>
> The Club moved to Stevenage College of Further Education in or around 1960. I joined the Club in 1962 as a 15 year old school boy.
>
> Geoff Coleman was the main organiser in the Club and it flourished. Stevenage became one of the leading clubs in County and when Geoff Coleman became ill with cancer I took over as match captain in around 1967. The Club continued to flourish and had a strong first team with several top County players. Stevenage won the Hertfordshire Club Championship which I believe was called the Puller Cup several times in this period. Our main rivals at that time were Watford and St Albans).We also competed in the National Club Championship (the National Club League did not exist at that time) with some distinction we reached the last 8 on one occasion. One of the most memorable matches was when we played Cambridge University and their team included William Hartston who was an England international and subsequently became an international master and won the British Championship.
>
> I moved from Stevenage in 1977.
>
> I see from your website the name of Arthur Gray and I knew him very well. When I was 14 he let me borrow a book called “Chess Questions Answered” which helped me to improve rapidly.

### Ken Maynard

> I joined the Club in the beginning of the 1969-70 season. It met in Stevenage College.
>
> I left Stevenage and moved to Milton Keynes in the mid-70s, 1975 I think.
>
> I returned to Stevenage in January 1980 and re-joined the club which used to meet in Springfield House. There was another chess club, Pin Green, was formed whilst I was away. I am not sure of its origins but I think that there was a body of members who wanted to able to have a drink. They met in the Pyramid pub in Pin Green.
>
> The Stevenage Club was suffering from a declining membership and I remember proposing an amalgamation with Pin Green at an AGM and it was accepted. I cannot remember when (maybe late 80s?) but if old fixture lists could be accessed, we could see when Pin Green Club ceased to exist. I
cannot remember in what order but we met in Timebridge Social Club and the Old Town Methodist Church Hall and of course our present venue.

### Mike Price

> Further to Ken's history recollections, I can fill in much further detail, but for now I can confirm the historic date of Thursday 22nd April 1999, when a Special General Meeting of Stevenage Chess Club met at Springfield House Community Centre, to consider the following proposal:
>
> The proposed amalgamation of Stevenage and Pin Green Chess Clubs, the new club to be called Stevenage Chess Club meeting at British Aerospace Sports and Social Club, Six Hills Way, Stevenage, on a Monday evening, the amalgamation to take place at the end of this playing season (May 1999).
>
> All the members present (plus the three proxy votes received by the Secretary) were favourable to this proposal and it was agreed nem con.
