## Recollections from club members

### Peter Brown

> I believe that the Club was first formed in the late 1950’s and its original venue was the offices of the Stevenage Development Corporation Daneshill House Danestrete - the same premises now occupied by Stevenage Borough Council. At least 2 of the original members worked for British Aerospace including Keith Hemingway (former British under 21 champion) and Paddy Ross. Other members included Geoff Coleman (match captain) and two pupils From Alleynes Grammar School - Rodney Lighton and Alan Griffiths.
>
> The Club moved to Stevenage College of Further Education in or around 1960. I joined the Club in 1962 as a 15 year old school boy.
>
> Geoff Coleman was the main organiser in the Club and it flourished. Stevenage became one of the leading clubs in County and when Geoff Coleman became ill with cancer I took over as match captain in around 1967. The Club continued to flourish and had a strong first team with several top County players. Stevenage won the Hertfordshire Club Championship which I believe was called the Puller Cup several times in this period. Our main rivals at that time were Watford and St Albans).We also competed in the National Club Championship (the National Club League did not exist at that time) with some distinction we reached the last 8 on one occasion. One of the most memorable matches was when we played Cambridge University and their team included William Hartston who was an England international and subsequently became an international master and won the British Championship.
>
> I moved from Stevenage in 1977.
>
> I see from your website the name of Arthur Gray and I knew him very well. When I was 14 he let me borrow a book called “Chess Questions Answered” which helped me to improve rapidly.

### Ken Maynard

> I joined the Club in the beginning of the 1969-70 season. It met in Stevenage College.
>
> I left Stevenage and moved to Milton Keynes in the mid-70s, 1975 I think.
>
> I returned to Stevenage in January 1980 and re-joined the club which used to meet in Springfield House. There was another chess club, Pin Green, was formed whilst I was away. I am not sure of its origins but I think that there was a body of members who wanted to able to have a drink. They met in the Pyramid pub in Pin Green.
>
> The Stevenage Club was suffering from a declining membership and I remember proposing an amalgamation with Pin Green at an AGM and it was accepted. I cannot remember when (maybe late 80s?) but if old fixture lists could be accessed, we could see when Pin Green Club ceased to exist. I
cannot remember in what order but we met in Timebridge Social Club and the Old Town Methodist Church Hall and of course our present venue.

### Mike Price

> Further to Ken's history recollections, I can fill in much further detail, but for now I can confirm the historic date of Thursday 22nd April 1999, when a Special General Meeting of Stevenage Chess Club met at Springfield House Community Centre, to consider the following proposal:
>
> The proposed amalgamation of Stevenage and Pin Green Chess Clubs, the new club to be called Stevenage Chess Club meeting at British Aerospace Sports and Social Club, Six Hills Way, Stevenage, on a Monday evening, the amalgamation to take place at the end of this playing season (May 1999).
>
> All the members present (plus the three proxy votes received by the Secretary) were favourable to this proposal and it was agreed nem con.
